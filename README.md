Ongoing development of a medication reminder program (running, but not properly) 

Progress made so far: 
  - Program accepts input of medication, and the amount of doses.
  - outputs a reminder of how many doses are left to take throughout the day.
  - Also includes a timer (In seconds until your next dose)
